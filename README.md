# Motivation
Counting involves <b>memory + reasoning.</b> To succeed, a system – humans included – must: 
1. <b>Persist knowledge</b> across time steps
2. <b>Retrieve + update</b> stored representations 
3. <b>Manipulate</b> those representations in working memory 

As sequence length grows, so does cognitive load, scaling roughly linearly + quickly exposing weaknesses. 

You can raise the bar further, by hiding your items (e.g. fruit) among distractors – restricting the target set to a semantic class. Under that setup, the counting task <b>also tests semantic identification,</b> the ability to distinguish concept boundaries, posing additional challenge. 

A model capable of the above is powerful because it binds <b>memory, attention, and concept formation</b> – abilities you’d need for tasks like multi-step planning or working across long time horizons.
